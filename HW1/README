Assignment #1
=============

This assigment entails the implementation of a set of simple functions that deal
with image manipulation as a warmup for the remainder of the course. As such,
it serves as a review of MATLAB to get things started.

The first function is 'rotate.m', which merely applies a rotation transformation
to a set of 2D-coordinates. Building on top of this, there's `rotate_image.m`, 
which implements the exact same functionality as MATLAB's native `imrotate.m`. 

Finally, `straighten.m` allows a user to select two points from a given image
that should be colinear on a horizontal line; the purpose of this function is to adjust an image such that some of its scene elements are straight to user's 
perspective and desire. It's a really useful function for photos in which 
elements in the background are not perfectly straight (e.g. ocean, canyon 
landscapes, etc). This function has the previous two as dependencies.
